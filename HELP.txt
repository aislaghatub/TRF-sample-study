TRF Sample Study Help

This tutorial is designed to help you learn how to do EEG signal analysis 
The example data given consists of 15 1 minute trials from a person listening to audio speech
In brief:
-> step 1 loads in raw EEG data (.bdf file) and saves it as .mat file
-> step 2 filters the EEG, downsamples it, removes bad channels, and epochs the data
-> step 3 runs the TRF to predict the EEG data using the envelope of the speech

Don't treat the code as a black box, play with it and figure out what it is doing where.

This webpage provides a tutorial for EEG data and will help you understand the steps outlined above!
